### Hi, I'm vi.

I'm a generalist producing applications, games, 3D products, music, videos, and graphics.

Most of the stuff here is personal projects for the web and unity.

Find me on [my website](https://v-os.ca), where I document my projects in a wiki format and write about the narrative universe that connects them.
Email me at [vi@v-os.ca](mailto:vi@v-os.ca) to get in touch!
