### Hi, I'm vi.

I'm a multidisciplinary designer and developer producing applications, games, 3D products, music, videos, and graphics.

Most of the stuff here is personal projects for the web and unity.

Find me on [my website](https://v-os.ca), where I document my projects in a wiki format and write about the narrative universe that connects them.
Email me at [victor.ivanov.design@gmail.com](mailto:victor.ivanov.design@gmail.com) for business inquiries, or if you just want to get in touch for a fun conversation!
